"""
An abstract class for DataSection subclasses that need to take inputs.

Inputs (e.g. tuples of strings of atom labels, or tuples of tuples of atom
labels) specify which pieces of data should be searched for. The result of
the search is a dictionary with each element from the inputs as keys and the
resulting data from the search as values.

    A subclass of DataSection for data that takes a set of inputs to search for.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _inputs : tuple
        A tuple of information (e.g. strings of atom labels, or of tuples that
        contain strings of atom labels) which signify which pieces of
        information should be searched for.

    Methods
    -------
    _find_data
        Searches the .out file for the desired data, which is used to store
        these data in the _data attribute.
    _search
        Abstract method which defines how each subclass of this class should
        go about searching the .out file for its particular type of data.
    get_inputs
        Returns a copy of the _inputs attribute.
